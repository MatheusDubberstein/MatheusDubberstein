# Hi there, I'm Matheus ðŸ‘‹
I'm a frontend developer passionate about creating accessible and user-friendly experiences. I love working with JavaScript and React, and I'm always exploring new tools and techniques to improve my skills. Besides coding, I enjoy automating workflows and diving into DIY electronics projects. Iâ€™m currently an electrical engineering student, which allows me to combine my love for technology with hands-on projects.
